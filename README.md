**Project Statement**

This project aims to forecast the closing prices of S&P 500 stocks using full historical daily market data. For each stock, the model will (1) predict the next trading day’s closing price and an associated probability estimate / uncertainty measure for that prediction, and (2) generate a weekly prediction profile, producing forecasts for each of the next seven trading days into the future. These forecasts will be built from the entire available price history, allowing later extension to more advanced sequence models and neural networks.
